SynSigGen: Create catalogs of synthetic mutational spectra for
assessing the performance of mutational-signature analysis programs.
}
\section{Overview}{


The main focus is generating synthetic catalogs of mutational
spectra (mutations in tumors) based on known mutational signature
profiles and attributions (assignment of exposures to tumors) in
the PCAWG7 data. We call this kind of synthetic
data broadly "reality-based" synthetic
data.  The package also has a set of functions that
generate random mutational signature profiles and then create
synthetic catalogs based on these random signature profiles. We
call this kind of synthetic data "random" synthetic data, while
pointing out that much depends on the distributions from which
the random signature profiles and attributions are generated.

Typical workflow for generating catalogs of "reality-based" synthetic
mutational spectra is as follows.

\preformatted{

Input (based on SignatureAnalyzer or SigProfiler analysis of PCAWG tumors)
  A, matrix of attributions (signatures x samples)
  S, mutational signature profiles (mutation type x signature)

P <- GetSynSigParamsFromExposures(A, ...)

synthetic.exposures <- GenerateSyntheticExposures(P, ...)

synthetic.spectra <- CreateAndWRiteCatalog(S, synthetic.exposures, ...)

T <- Signatures extracted by SignatureAnalzer or SigProfiler on synthetic.spectra

SummarizeResults(T, S, synthetic.exposures, ...)

}
}

\section{Creating Synthetic Mutational Catalogs}{


These functions create synthetic mutational catalogs based
on parameters derived from signature profiles
and attributions (exposures).
}

\section{Comparing two sets of mutational signatures}{


Functions for comparing mutational signatures and
sets of mutational signatures. Often we will be interested
in comparing signature profiles extracted from synthetic data to the
ground-truth signature profiles.
