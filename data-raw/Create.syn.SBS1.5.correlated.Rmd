  exposures are highly correlated.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Required libraries and set output path

```{r librariesEtc}
library(SynSigGen)
SetNewOutDir("tmp.syn.SBS1.5.correlated")
```

## Generate synthetic exposures

```{r SetGlobalVariables}
set.seed(1)
num.syn.tumors <- 500
```

```{r Load Experimental Parameters}
set.seed(1)
num.syn.tumors <- 500
```





## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
