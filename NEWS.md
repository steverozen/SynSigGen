## SynSigGen 1.0.6
### Added 
* Added data object "SBS1SBS5datasetNames" as names of SBS1-SBS5 spectra datasets generated by CreateSBS1SBS5CorrelatedSyntheticData()

* Added new argument `sig.matrix` in functions `GenerateSynExposureOneSample` and `GenerateSyntheticExposures` so that we can resample the synthetic exposures to make
sure the total mutations for the reconstructed catalog is not zero.

### Fixed 
* Fixed a bug in `GetSynSigParamsFromExposures` when the exposures only have one row that are
not all zeros.

## SynSigGen 1.0.5
### Simplified
* Simplified folder structure of SBS1-SBS5-correlated dataset,
generated by `CreateSBS1SBS5CorrelatedSyntheticData()` - 
The files of synthetic datasets are under the dataset folders, and no more
`sp.sp` folders.

## SynSigGen 1.0.4
### Last version generates SBS1-SBS5-correlated dataset with two-layer directory  structure:

* Name of dataset (e.g. `S.0.1.Rsq.0.1`)
* Folder `sp.sp`, means that two ground-truth signatures (`SBS1` and `SBS5`) are from results of SigProfiler in (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-1943-3)
* Files of synthetic datasets.

### Clarified
* Clarified package `README`
* Clarified package documentation
* Clarified function documentation

### Fixed typo 
* Renamed function `Create.3.4.40.Abstract()` to `Create.3.5.40.Abstract()`

## SynSigGen 1.0.3
* Removed `R/SigSimilarity.R` (functionality now in `ICAMSxtra`)
  and adjusted code in this package.

## SynSigGen 1.0.2.9001

### Added
* Added function `AddNoise`.
* Added `biocViews` as a field name in package [DESCRIPTION](https://github.com/steverozen/SynSigGen/blob/master/DESCRIPTION).
* Created reference manual.
