## SynSigGen 1.0.6
### Added 
* Added data object "SBS1SBS5datasetNames" as names of SBS1-SBS5 spectra datasets generated by `CreateSBS1SBS5CorrelatedSyntheticData()`.

* Added new argument `sig.matrix` in functions `GenerateSynExposureOneSample` and `GenerateSyntheticExposures` so that we can re-sample the synthetic exposures to make
sure the total mutations for the reconstructed catalog is not zero.

* Created new exported functions `GenerateSyntheticTumors()` and `GenerateNoisyTumors()` and 
added examples.

* Users can specify output directory when running functions to generate data sets used in Nature paper.

* As updated in README.md, users need to explicitly specify `regress.dir = NULL` unless users need to compare generated data sets with data sets stored in data-raw/long.test.regression.data. Of note, the comparison is based on diff command and the comparison can break due to the file endings (CRLF in Windows and LF in Linux), trailing white spaces, or last digits of a decimal. A better alternative is to use diff and merge tools e.g. Beyond Compare, Meld, WinMerge, etc. 

### Fixed 
* Fixed a bug in `GetSynSigParamsFromExposures()` when the exposures only have one row that are
not all zeros.

## SynSigGen 1.0.5
### Simplified
* Simplified folder structure of SBS1-SBS5-correlated dataset,
generated by `CreateSBS1SBS5CorrelatedSyntheticData()` - 
The files of synthetic datasets are under the dataset folders, and no more
`sp.sp` folders.

## SynSigGen 1.0.4
### Last version generates SBS1-SBS5-correlated dataset with two-layer directory  structure:

* Name of dataset (e.g. `S.0.1.Rsq.0.1`)
* Folder `sp.sp`, means that two ground-truth signatures (`SBS1` and `SBS5`) are from results of SigProfiler in (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-1943-3)
* Files of synthetic datasets.

### Clarified
* Clarified package `README`
* Clarified package documentation
* Clarified function documentation

### Fixed typo 
* Renamed function `Create.3.4.40.Abstract()` to `Create.3.5.40.Abstract()`

## SynSigGen 1.0.3
* Removed `R/SigSimilarity.R` (functionality now in `ICAMSxtra`)
  and adjusted code in this package.

## SynSigGen 1.0.2.9001

### Added
* Added function `AddNoise`.
* Added `biocViews` as a field name in package [DESCRIPTION](https://github.com/steverozen/SynSigGen/blob/master/DESCRIPTION).
* Created reference manual.
